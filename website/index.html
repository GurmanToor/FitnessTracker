                <h3>Vision Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    The Fitness Tracker System will be used to track, interact, evaluate, and maintain information 
                    pertaining to a user’s general wellness and fitness activities. Similar to applications such as 
                    ‘myfitnesspal’, the system will be used predominantly as a method of keeping all fitness related
                    activities stored in an organized fashion. The system will be used as a means of aiding a user to 
                    obtain their fitness goals and desires. It will have features to log information such as: The users 
                    weight, height, age, gender, log any food intake, log their exercise, among others. The system will use the 
                    information that the user has inputted as well as give the user information required to further their fitness level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The primary demographic for a user that we are looking at, is a user with any level of experience in fitness that has a 
                    smart device and the drive to go out and enjoy the world of fitness and lead a healthy lifestyle; Including but not limited 
                    to people who want to lose weight, people who want to calculate their calorie intake and people who want to find exercises that 
                    fit their needs. The system will keep their goals and fitness activities organized for them, making it one less worry for the user 
                    and more time to focus on their fitness. Users with little to a large amount of experience will equally find this system useful in 
                    tracking their fitness activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The system will be used for evaluating caloric input and output through means of fitness and food intake. The system, being able to track food and workouts, 
                    along with the user’s physical characteristics, will show the user their current caloric and nutritional levels catered towards the 
                    user itself to ensure proper physical maintenance for each specific user. For caloric input, the user will be able to easily log what 
                    they ate throughout the day, whilst the system updates the users current caloric and nutritional daily summary. The user will also be 
                    able to view their past food intake from any specific day and view their nutritional progress and, as a result, will be able to recognize 
                    bad eating patterns and foods that they may need to avoid in the future. An overview will be accessible to the user to see their total calorie 
                    intake, calories they burned during exercise, daily calorie surplus or loss and diet advice. By having the user log their meals and having the 
                    application count the calories for them, the user’s personal weight loss/gain goals will become much more attainable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being able to track and log your workouts easily is a big component of this application. This will give the ability for users to easily record their reps 
                    for specific muscle exercises, view previous reps achieved as well as receive recommended reps based on these previous values. Cardio workouts
                    will be similar, they will have a time and distance recording features, and similarly allow previous times/distances to be seen while getting 
                    recommended distance or time goals to achieve for the current workouts. Having easy access to previous workouts and getting recommended goals 
                    to achieve will give the user something to strive for and give them more incentive to go through with the workout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We want our application to be a vehicle for behavior change in fitness. Many people want to develop their fitness, but they give up a 
                    few days into their journey. Hence, the criteria of success for this project will hinge on its aptness to motivate whilst keeping the user 
                    accountable on their jaunt to their fitness goals. The project will be judged as successful if over 75% of users report an increased 
                    engagement with their fitness lifestyle.
                </p>

                <h3>Major functionality</h3>
                <p>
                    Our application contains several areas pertaining to the areas of personal wellness. Firstly, there is an area to log and manage workouts such
                    as weight training and running. Additionally, another function of the application is an area where the user can log and manage their personal weight.
                    Along with the functions of managing personal notes/logs and a nutritional intake area, the application gives the user the ability to track all areas
                    of their wellness from their workouts to personal statistic tracking, to maintaining their caloric intake compared to their outtake.

                <h3>Sales Pitch</h3>
                <p>As we move towards a new age where personal wellness is near top priority, there will be a continued need for systems where users can track their personal
                    fitness and statistics in order to pursue their fitness goals. Our fitness application is built around the goal of having one application for the users
                    entire personal fitness needs. The user does not need to have many applications just to properly track their fitness goals, as the application caters to
                    those that want to track their food intake, workouts and everything in between. With an extensive all-in-one approach, the user may find themselves installing the
                    application and never uninstalling it again.<br></p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    During the development of the application, the most notable issues that arose were our issues with merge conflicts through git and
                    spending many hours on bugs related to android studio or the build of the project itself. A large part of the time invested in the
                    application was purely bug fixing or getting our code to work with eachothers code along with ensuring our code works with the
                    project itself. In the beginning of the project we created a vision statement. Albeit our vision differs from the current application
                    that we have now (way less features), we are confident that given continued development we would meet our vision statement. The current
                    state of the application is a representation of the early development of what we would like the final product to look like. The project itself
                    was an amazing experience, however a lesson that we unfortunately had to learn was that most of the project time is just working through
                    issues with the ide or file sharing service. As programmers, we are very proud of our work, but as aforementioned we were snake-bitten
                    several times due to confusion around the programs/services accompanied with android studio and the project instructions itself. For example,
                    using time spent as a quantifier, there was a time before the second iteration where we were all on a group call for 9 hours in order to fix
                    our merge issues, no new code was written, just fixes. Although that could be seen as a negative experience, as a group we relished in the
                    experience and we made sure to have fun with it too. Everyone's greatest fear when it comes to group projects is being paired with impassive group members. But in this group we had a sense of togetherness,
                    everyone was always willing to help out when someone got overwhelmed with a feature, and owing to our vision to create one of the best fitness apps ever to hit
                    the market, we were all committed to the project and we enjoyed working on it, excluding factums of realization that the deadline is just in the lurks. This was
                    a great learning experience for all of us, and there is no question that this project has certainly helped us ameliorate our skillset as programmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, our project differs somewhat from how we imagined, although for example the architecture we used is similar to that of the sample project:
                    We used an n-tier architecture where we divided our classes into folders to match this architecture, so we have a presentation folder holding all our UI/Activity classes, a <b>business</b> folder to hold the logic layer classes,<b>persistence</b> folder holding our
                    database classes, and then a domain_specific_objects folder to hold our objects classes. We ensured to maintain the same systems and standards that we set in the first
                    iteration, while attempting to adapt from our learned lessons. Furthermore, after the second iteration we discussed [RETROSPECTIVE.md] solutions for some of our issues, such as consistently
                    pushing our work in git as an attempt to decrease merge conflicts along with maintaining communication in where we are working in the project. We maintained an increased communication
                    through the third iteration, and we found that we had very little merge conflicts. There are still a few issues pertaining to working around issues within the IDE or gradle, however it has
                    been found to be minimized. Additionally, there are a few bugs that we could not get fixed by the end of the third iteration, for example:
                    The delete button for a Workout in the Workout History section is currently deactivated. It has a bug where when delete all the workouts, and you try to go to the 'New' workout section,you cant go create a new workout, it crashes for some reason,
                    so had to comment out the code for this delete button. Thus it will show all workouts created in the Workout History section, but you cant delete any from here.
                    Albeit we still have a few outstanding bugs and interpersonal issues, we believe that we have set a very good foundation with working as a team and how to work in a project setting for software development, however this
                    third iteration does not entirely reflect our goals and abilities, as we have had many real life setbacks during this iteration. We underwent a large snowstorm, many many deadlines
                    for other courses, and a flooded basement, but we maintained our lessons that we learned and turned the hardship to a potential to prove we are an amazing team. As a team, there needs to be a structured plan and regular meetings. It is important that everyone voices their ideas, issues, and success as it will most likely help out others in the team.
                    A code-like-hell pattern of programming seems to be the default choice for most novice programmers, but now that we are knowledgeable on design patterns,
                    TDD, and SOLID, we would definitely adopt a more thoughtful approach when taking on future projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short, we found that this project has been an amazing learning experience for working as a team in software engineering, and if we were to do anything different
                    if we could start over, it would be to solve these merging and IDE based issues FIRST, so we would not have to deal with it with such a large project. However, as
                    the kids say, the only way around those issues is simple, just merge first and let the last guy deal with it! In all seriousness, if the real world of software engineering
                    is similar to this project, then we are all very excited to join the world of software engineering.

                <p>First Iteration [Estimated 20 days / Spent 20 days]: During the first iteration, the estimated and spent working days
                lined up fairly well, only by chance however. There were a few features where we overestimated the time we estimated as well
                as underestimated the time we spent. For example, we estimated 1d and spent 4d or estimated 4d and spent 1d. The outliers
                just happened to line up.</p>
                <p>
                    Second Iteration [Estimated 17 days / Spent 16 days]: For the second iteration, we ensured that we learned from our previous
                    iteration, we put more thought into the estimates and discussed on how long we felt it would take, we no longer had our
                    estimates as individual assignments. This iterations estimates vs time spent was more consistent, but we also wanted
                    to improve by putting more research into our work before making the estimate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third Iteration [Estimated 13 days / Spent 13 days]: For the third iteration, we put research into making our estimates
                    first, but ended up with the same problems as the first iteration. We had some issues with a few outlying estimates as we
                    had to move a feature to this iteration, and we also had some real life roadblocks such as finals for other classes and
                    a couple storms causing issues. However, given no outside issues, we are very confident that we can properly make estimates
                    for our work from now on. NOTE: Our estimated and spent days are low as we spent more hours/days working on the website, testing
                    and other items that are not technically features.
