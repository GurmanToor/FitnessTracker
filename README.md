PURPOSE: This Fitness Tracker is designed to accompany a user in the journey to physical wellness through tracking their fitness and general caloric input/output. With an all-in-one extensive approach, the fitness tracker aims to combine several aspects of fitness tracking in to one application instead of having to install several applications just to track your general fitness. 

HOW TO TRAVERSE APP: From the login page, you can log in using the credentials given below, or create your own credentials. This will take you to the main screen where you can click on given buttons depending on the feature you would like to access, one to create a new workout or one to create a new weight log. We also added a progress bar, click on that will take you to input your calories intake with breakfast /lunch /dinner option. There is also a food intake area where the user can add 'meals' as well. 

For tests, you may run the classes "...AllTests" in com.example.fitness_tracker.business. There are 3 'allTests' classes for the 3 areas of the tests.

For running the app [our emulator is 'NEXUS 7 API x's], you may run the application and either 'create an account' or use the default account information: user -> janesmith123 password -> password123.
